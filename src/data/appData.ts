  // About
  text1About:
    "Ever since I can remember I was always curious about how things work behind the scenes. My passion for programming started from watching YouTubers who did amazing things using programming so I decided its time to become a programmer. Fast-forward to 2019, I started learning Software Engineering in Ruppin technological college. In 2021 I've graduated with an average grade of 90 and got my diploma.",
